# 🏎️ F1 ScrollTrigger Animation with GSAP

This project is a Formula 1–themed scroll animation created using **GSAP** and **ScrollTrigger**. As the user scrolls, the F1 car drives across the screen, a dynamic cover swipes through, and the logo animates with depth — all synced beautifully with scroll interactions.
